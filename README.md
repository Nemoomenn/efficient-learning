# Learning to Learn [Efficient Learning]



## The Principles

This section is all about changing the mindset. This section will help our brain to look at the world in a different way.

1. ### Learning Vs. Winning the System

   To be an efficient learner the focus must shift from simply winning the system to actual long term learning which might not make you feel good at the beginning.

2. ### What is Success?

   You need to work hard for what you want and the easy route is taken by those with no drive and persistence. To succeed, You will need to take risks and make mistakes. You have to do the unconventional. Those who succeed are the ones who traveled and who have a drive and persistence.

   

3. ### The Obstacle 

   Nobody is good at anything at first. All the world's most successful people were beginners at their craft. Once there was a time, Bill Gates couldn't code, Elon Musk probably couldn't do any addition. At first we're all just beginners. If you succeeded right away and you didn't encounter any obstacles that's actually a bad thing because you won't learn the hard lessons that failures teach. 

   What you do when you encounter obstacles and failures will define your future success..

   

4. ### The Dip

     Push enough so that you can overcome those obstacles but also know when the dip is there and you should turn around. Not very motivational but  it's the truth.

5. ### Compound Learning

   "Improve by 1% a day, and in 70 days you're twice as good." - Alan Weiss

   Small changes that we make each day have a compounding effects later on in our lives.

   

6. ### Failures Don't Count

   Failures don't count against us. We can fail for a hundred, or thousands times, All that matters is where we are now in our current state. Every failure brings you closer to where you want to be. Instead of being the type of person that avoids doing things because you're afraid of failing, you're afraid of judgment. Start using this principle and realize that these failures just don't count against you. Each time you make a mistake, You get closer and closer to your goal and those that never try will never ever beat out those that try and fail.

   

7. ### Choice VS. Chore

   Shift your focus from “I must do that” to “I want to do that.” In the long term, The choice will always beat out the chore.

   

8. ### It's all in the Frame

   Shift/Re-Frame your perspective to positive things.

   

9. ### Pareto Principle

   The **Pareto principle** states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes

   Is this the best use of my time? Adding things doesn't necessarily mean better, Instead focus on that core 20 percent.

   

10. ### Skill Stacking

    It's not about being the greatest at one thing. You just need to be pretty good at a list of useful skills that when combined makes you truly one of a kind.

    

11. ### Happiness Factors

    Identify the areas/things/people that make you happy - if you’re happy, you will be able to learn better.

    

12. ### Your Productivity Time

     Find your productivity time and give yourself the permission to study when you feel the best. Everyone is different.

    

13. ### Self Learning Paradigm

    Nobody is going to tell you to learn a topic to improve your skills to develop further and further each day. That is a choice you have to make.
